## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used npx for scaffolding then converted to Bun (bun x interactive prompt issues)
- [01-01]: ESM import for ws module instead of require() for TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui Neutral base color chosen (aligns with minimalistic design philosophy)
- [01-02]: Applied migrations via psql instead of drizzle-kit migrate (Neon driver cannot connect to local PostgreSQL)
- [01-02]: Private note RLS uses RESTRICTIVE tenant + permissive author-only (AND logic)
- [01-02]: Junction table RLS via subquery JOIN to parent table for tenant isolation
- [Roadmap]: AI ships in v1 (phases 7-8), not deferred to v3 -- core product differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6, 7, 9 can execute in parallel after Phase 5 (all depend only on Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Google Calendar integration deferred to v2 per REQUIREMENTS.md (not in v1 scope)
- [Roadmap]: Design-first approach applied per-phase (mockups within each phase's plans, not a separate phase)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 7]: Google App Verification for calendar OAuth scopes takes 2-4 weeks -- initiate early if calendar moves to v1
- [Phase 1]: Neon default role has BYPASSRLS -- must create dedicated app role before any tenant data is written (RESOLVED: app_user created in 01-01, granted in 01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Private note key_version field missing from existing docs/data-model.md schema -- must be added (RESOLVED: added in 01-02 schema)
- [Phase 1]: drizzle-kit migrate does not work with local PostgreSQL (Neon driver requires WebSocket) -- use psql for local migrations
